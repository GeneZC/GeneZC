### About [Me](https://genezc.github.io)

I am currently a Ph.D. student at Beijing Institute of Technology. My current research interests lie in the general area of natural language processing, particularly in 1) fine-grained opinion mining, 2) generalization and accelaration of pretrained language models. Prior to devoting myself to natural language processing, I did a variety of work on game AI.
