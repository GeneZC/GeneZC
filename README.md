### About [Me](https://genezc.github.io)

I am currently a Ph.D. student at Beijing Institute of Technology. My current research interests lie in the general area of natural language processing, particularly in generalization and accelaration of pretrained language models. Prior to that, I did a variety of work on fine-grained opinion mining.
